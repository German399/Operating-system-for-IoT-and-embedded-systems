  *  @brief  DPC stub.
  *  Deferred procedures work in context of ISR.
  *  This DPC implementation is intended to be used with unified interrupt 
  *  architecture.
  *  DPC request results in direct call of deferred function instead of putting 
  *  it into queue. Because inserting of DPC is usually performed in ISR,
  *  deferred function may be called at SPL greater than DISPATCH.
