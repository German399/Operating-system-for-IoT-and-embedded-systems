    // There's special case when threaded tickless timers are used.
    // Usually system timers are handled at SPL=DISPATCH and have separate
    // infrastructure in case when timers are handled by thread. This is
    // because quanta timers may not be handled in thread since they always
    // yield timer thread who executes their callbacks instead of thread who
    // sets the quanta. In tickless case it is extremely difficult to support
    // two infrastructures for both application and system timers. So we use 
    // the following trick for thread quantas: System timers are mapped to
    // application timers, timer thread is activated every time when quanta 
    // expires in any other thread and preemption occurs. During context switch
    // this function is called for thread with expired quanta, if we see that
    // cancelled system timer is expired, thread yield function should be called
    // manually. So, timer thread activation is used as quanta trigger.
    // This design introduces extra overhead for every quanta expiration and
    // is considered as a temporary solution.
