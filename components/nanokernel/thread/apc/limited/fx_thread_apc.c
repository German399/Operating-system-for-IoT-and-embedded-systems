  *  @file   fx_thread_apc.c
  *  @brief  Implementation of limited APCs.
  *  Design note: Normally thread termination dispatching is performed as 
  *  APC procedure executing in context of the target thread. This is neccessary
  *  for multiprocessor systems in order to synchronize with the thread 
  *  execution. In uniprocessor systems termination APC may be implemented in 
  *  more efficient way: if target function (termination handler) is SPL 
  *  agnostic (may be called at both LOW and DISPATCH levels) it may be directly
  *  called instead of sending APC message. APC queuing may be performed at SPL
  *  = DISPATCH only, so, in uniprocessor system we're already synchronized with
  *  all threads in the system. This implementation is intended to be used in 
  *  simple configurations with kernel only (without executive subsystem). It 
  *  does NOT support APC masking, deferred delivery, custom APC messages, etc.
