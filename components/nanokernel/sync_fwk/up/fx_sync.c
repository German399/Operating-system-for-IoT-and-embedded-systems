  *  @file   fx_sync.c
  *  @brief  Implementation of common synchronization layer.
  *  It provides simple wait/notify interface, which can be used to implement 
  *  sync primitives. This implementation supports uniprocessor systems only.
  *  Since on uniprocessor systems SPL is already guarantees proper 
  *  synchronization, waitable locking functions are unused.
