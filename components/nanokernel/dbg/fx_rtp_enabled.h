  *  @brief  Interface to run-time protection module (canary like).
  *  Runtime protection is implemented as 'magic-values'.
  *  Every object has special internal member and unique key value.
  *  Every time when someone is going to use any object it examines that member
  *  which should be equal to magic value.
